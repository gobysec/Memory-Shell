#JavaWeb Memory Shell
Traditional webshell backdoors, no matter how much effort is put into hiding or how they are disguised, are unable to persist in the target system under existing defense measures. Some simple examples of defense measures include: 
For terminal security: file monitoring, anti-tampering, and EDR; 
For backdoors: webshell detection and traffic monitoring; For the network layer: firewalls to prevent reverse connections, and reverse proxy systems to hide real IPs; 
and so on. 

**From asset detection, vulnerability scanning, injection of memory shells to management of webshells, they can all be directly completed by Goby.**
